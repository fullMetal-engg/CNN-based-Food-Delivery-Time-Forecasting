# CNN-based-Food-Delivery-Time-Forecasting
This project aims to predict the estimated delivery time for food orders using machine learning techniques, particularly a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By leveraging various factors such as weather conditions, traffic, order priority, vehicle type, and historical delivery data, the model helps in accurately forecasting delivery times.
